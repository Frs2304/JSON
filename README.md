## JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is a text format that is completely language-independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.

# Getting Started

To get started with JSON, you don't need to install anything. JSON is a format for encoding data structures, so all you need is a text editor or a tool that can generate and parse JSON.

# Usage

JSON is commonly used in web applications to transmit data between a server and a client. JSON data can be stored in a file with the .json extension, or it can be transmitted over the network as a string.
